    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I wanted to recreate my favorite Chinese shrimp and broccoli takeout dish.
      After several attempts, here is the result! Serve over hot cooked rice.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups fresh broccoli florets</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons peanut oil</li>
      <li>4 large cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 cup low-sodium chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger root</li>
      <li>1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
      <li>Â¼ cup canned water chestnuts, drained</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine broccoli and water in a glass bowl; steam in microwave oven
        until slightly tender, 2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat peanut oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add
        garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to low. Add
        chicken broth, soy sauce, oyster sauce, and ginger root to the garlic;
        bring to a boil. Add shrimp; cook and stir until the shrimp turn pink, 3
        to 4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Toss steamed broccoli and water chestnuts with shrimp mixture to coat
        with sauce. Stir cornstarch into mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time, until
        sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
