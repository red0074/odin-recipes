      These 30-minute hoisin-glazed meatballs are sweet, saucy, and simple
      enough for a weeknight supper.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound 80% lean ground beef</li>
      <li>1/2 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons less-sodium soy sauce, divided</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger</li>
      <li>1/2 cup hoisin sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
      <li>1 green onion, minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 pound green beans, trimmed</li>
      <li>hot cooked white rice, for serving</li>
      <li>toasted sesame seeds and sliced green onion, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put ground beef, panko, egg, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 2 cloves garlic,
        and 1 teaspoon ginger in a bowl; stir until just combined (do not
        overwork). Gently shape mixture into 11/2-inch balls. Arrange on
        prepared baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into
        centers of meatballs registers 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, stir together hoisin sauce, honey, green onion, vinegar,
        sesame oil, and remaining 3 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 clove garlic, and
        1/2 teaspoon ginger in a large saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat,
        stirring occasionally, until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Reserve
        2 tablespoons sauce in a small bowl for green beans. Add meatballs to
        remaining sauce in saucepan; cook until flavors meld, about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
        Add beans; cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and lightly
        blistered, 4 to 5 minutes. Add reserved sauce to beans; stir to coat.
        Serve meatballs with beans over rice. Garnish with sesame seeds and
        green onion.

    </ol>
